		<p>Time for a progress report.</p>
<p>I successfully booted a Linux kernel on the Retromini some weeks ago.
 I won‚Äôt paste the whole kernel boot here, but you can read it by <a href="/assets/rs90-kernel-boot.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clicking here</a>.</p>
<p>Since then, I&quot;ve been adding support for the various hardware 
components of the Retromini in the upstream drivers if they exist, or 
writting new drivers otherwise.</p>
<p>Here is a list of the hardware components, and their current state:</p>

</table>
<p>If I find some time in the next few days, I will clean up and push on Github the current git tree I‚Äôm working on.</p>
<p>Some things I thought I‚Äôd share:</p>
<ul>
<li>The JZ4725B SoC used by the Retromini is actually newer than the 
JZ4740. Some hardware blocks are more similar to the JZ4770 than the 
JZ4740.</li>
<li>The RTC does not retain the date across reboots. This sucks, as I 
won‚Äôt be able to play Pok√©mon games then, as they rely a lot on time. 
Maybe a hardware modification could make it work?</li>
<li>The buttons are for the most part GPIO-mapped. The R button is not 
available when serial logging is enabled, is it uses the same pin as RX.
 Also, for some reason the SELECT button is not GPIO-mapped, but 
connected to the Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC). Whoever thought it 
was a good idea, should burn in hell.</li>
</ul>
<p>That‚Äôs all folks!</p>

		<h1 class="entry-title"><a href="/retromini/2018/07/12/ubiboot-on-the-retromini.html">UBIBoot on the RetroMini</a></h1>
		<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>For those who don‚Äôt know, I had written a bootloader called UBIBoot, 
quite a long time ago, for the Dingoo A320. As its name suggests, it 
supported booting from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBIFS#UBI" target="_blank">UBI</a>
 volume on the NAND. That is to say, it was able to boot a Linux kernel 
on the only Dingoo A320 with the internal NAND formatted as UBI: my own.
 I trashed the native OS and was running <a href="http://www.treewalker.org/opendingux/" target="_blank">OpenDingux</a> directly on the internal NAND.</p>
<p>The job of UBIBoot was to initialize the main <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLL" target="_blank">PLL</a>,
 the clocks, set the pins of the SoC in the right mode, initialize the 
SDRAM, initialize the NAND, initialize the SD card controller, and then 
finally, boot Linux from the first FAT partition of the SD card if 
there‚Äôs one inserted, or from the ‚Äúkernel‚Äù UBI drive of the internal 
NAND.</p>
<p>All of that in about 5 kilobytes.</p>
<p>Before the <a href="http://www.gcw-zero.com/" target="_blank">GCW Zero</a>
 came out, I got a prototype (with 256 MiB RAM), and ported UBIBoot to 
it. It then became the default and official bootloader for the GCW Zero 
when it was retailed months later.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs a fun story about it: the GCW Zero prototype didn‚Äôt have 
marks on the main board to show where the UART pads were, so I ported 
UBIBoot without having any output log: instead, I was blinking the LCD. 
My test passed? LCD turned on. It failed? The LCD remained off. Repeat 
for everything you need to test in your code. Next time it will be 
faster for me to learn Morse code and make the LCD blink Morse code to 
me üôÇ</p>
<p>Anyway, I disgress. I ported UBIBoot to the RetroMini, and the code 
is in the master branch now, which means it‚Äôs officially supported. <a href="https://github.com/pcercuei/UBIBoot" target="_blank">The code is available here</a>.</p>
<p>Note that right now, it only supports booting from an external 
micro-SD card. I did not try to flash it on the NAND; I want to dump the
 NAND before starting to overwrite it with random stuff.</p>
<p>To compile:<br>
<code>CONFIG=rs90 make</code></p>
<p>For the stage1 variant, where UBIBoot will only initialize the hardware then return to the USB loader:<br>
<code> CONFIG=rs90 STAGE1_ONLY=y make</code></p>
<p>Note that right now, it‚Äôs only useful for people with <a href="/retromini/2018/07/07/adding-uart-to-the-retromini.html" target="_blank">a UART cable soldered</a> and who want to boot their own Linux kernel (or other operating system).</p>
<p>Next step: boot Linux!</p>

		<h1 class="entry-title"><a href="/retromini/2018/07/07/adding-uart-to-the-retromini.html">Adding UART to the RetroMini</a></h1>
		<p>I recently bought a RetroMini.</p>
<p>For those who don‚Äôt know, the Retromini is a cheap ($25) chinese handheld gaming console, like there exist hundreds of variants.</p>
<p>What sets it apart, in my opinion, is that it‚Äôs perfectly tailored 
for emulating GameBoy and GameBoy Advance games. The D-pad and face 
buttons are the best ones I‚Äôve seen since the original GameBoy, and the 
screen is beautiful (I heard it‚Äôs actually the exact same screen as in 
the GBA Micro). The shape is also perfect, I don‚Äôt get cramps playing, 
which I had on the original GBA. The sound is good, the device is small 
enough to fit in a pocket (size of a GameBoy Pocket more or less). The 
only critic I have is for the L/R buttons, which are microswitches, and 
awkward to use. But I can live with that, I‚Äôd mostly play Pok√©mon anyway
 üôÇ</p>
<p>Besides, the reason I bought it isn‚Äôt really for playing GBA games, 
but because its System-on-chip (SoC), the central piece containing the 
processor and the device controllers, is an old Ingenic JZ4725B. I‚Äôve 
been playing with the JZ4740 on the Dingoo A320, the JZ4770 on the GCW 
Zero, and the JZ4780 on the MIPS Creator CI20, trying to upstream 
support for this SoC into the Linux kernel. Owning the RetroMini means I
 can test the drivers I write to one more Ingenic SoC, and start to 
support it upstream.</p>
<p>To write code for the RetroMini, I need two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>a way to load my code into the RAM and have the CPU execute it;</li>
<li>a way to see what my code is actually doing.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Loading the code</h2>
<p>Point 1). is easy; by powering ON the RetroMini while pressing B, the
 CPU will switch into a special mode where it will listen for commands 
on the USB bus. By sending specially crafted commands, it is possible to
 load custom code to the RetroMini. To make the process easier, I wrote a
 tool called&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/opendingux/jzboot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jzboot</a> that will upload the code to the RetroMini.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Debugging the code via UART</h2>
<p>The simplest way to debug your code is to just make it print stuff to
 the output console. Print register contents, print ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù if your 
check worked, print ‚Äúoh noes‚Äù if it failed‚Ä¶ If your program outputs text
 to the console, the whole process of writing a program becomes much 
easier.</p>
<p>The problem is getting the text output.</p>
<p>When you load code to the RetroMini, its hardware is in an 
uninitialized state; the RAM won‚Äôt work, the micro SD won‚Äôt work, and 
the LCD won‚Äôt work. This means that unless you write code to initialize 
it, you won‚Äôt be able to display text on the LCD. Thanksfully, there is 
another way, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter" target="_blank">UART</a>.
 By connecting the TX and RX pins of the UART of the SoC&nbsp; to an 
external UART receiver, we can receive on a PC the output of our 
program.</p>
<p>By looking at <a href="/assets/JZ4725B_DS.pdf">the datasheet</a> (section 2.3.2) I could deduce that the <strong>TX</strong> pin was the pin number <strong>58</strong>, and the <strong>RX</strong> pin was the pin number <strong>57</strong>.
 Following closely the traces on the PCB (with a multimeter), I ended up
 soldering wires to the following points (click to enlarge):</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/rs90_uart_pads.jpg"></p>
<p>You should connect these pins to a UART-to-USB adapter. Search for <strong>FTDI</strong> on your favourite online store. Here is an example: <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/FT232RL-FTDI-USB-3-3V-5-5V-to-TTL-Serial-Adapter-Module-for-Arduino-Mini-Port/222721031019?epid=1983299799&amp;hash=item33db353b6b:g:vdoAAOSwEZdaDLpc" target="_blank">UART to USB adapter</a>.
 The important thing is that it should work in 3.3V. Most of these 
modules come with a jumper to toggle between 5V and 3.3V I/O, it must be
 set to 3.3V if you don‚Äôt want to toast your RetroMini.</p>
<p>Then, solder the PCB‚Äôs <strong>TX</strong> to the adapter‚Äôs <strong>RX</strong>, the PCB‚Äôs <strong>RX</strong> to the adapter‚Äôs <strong>TX</strong>, and the two <strong>GND</strong> points together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Making the RetroMini more retro</h2>
<p>I didn‚Äôt want to solder my UART-to-USB module directly on the PCB, it
 wouldn‚Äôt look good and wouldn‚Äôt be practical should I want to actually 
play on the RetroMini. So I just drilled a hole on the back of the case 
and put a SUBD-9 connector there, the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù connector for UART:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/rs90_uart_subd9.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/rs90_uart_subd9_debug.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Looks good right? üòâ</p>
<p>Next step: write some code!</p>

		<p>Welcome to my devblog!</p>
<p>I‚Äôve been thinking for some time about starting it; not that I like 
much to write about what I do, but I‚Äôve been hacking some pretty amazing
 stuff, and won decent knowledge about programming languages, 
electronics, low-level magic, operating systems and device drivers 
development, Linux kernel hacking, dynamic code recompilation‚Ä¶ that it 
would be sad not to write about my experience and my experiments as I 
go.</p>
<p>So buckle your seatbelt, we‚Äôre going for a ride into my world, and it‚Äôs going to get bumpy.</p>
