<p>I recently bought a RetroMini.</p>
<p>For those who don‚Äôt know, the Retromini is a cheap ($25) chinese handheld gaming console, like there exist hundreds of variants.</p>
<p>What sets it apart, in my opinion, is that it‚Äôs perfectly tailored 
for emulating GameBoy and GameBoy Advance games. The D-pad and face 
buttons are the best ones I‚Äôve seen since the original GameBoy, and the 
screen is beautiful (I heard it‚Äôs actually the exact same screen as in 
the GBA Micro). The shape is also perfect, I don‚Äôt get cramps playing, 
which I had on the original GBA. The sound is good, the device is small 
enough to fit in a pocket (size of a GameBoy Pocket more or less). The 
only critic I have is for the L/R buttons, which are microswitches, and 
awkward to use. But I can live with that, I‚Äôd mostly play Pok√©mon anyway
 üôÇ</p>
<p>Besides, the reason I bought it isn‚Äôt really for playing GBA games, 
but because its System-on-chip (SoC), the central piece containing the 
processor and the device controllers, is an old Ingenic JZ4725B. I‚Äôve 
been playing with the JZ4740 on the Dingoo A320, the JZ4770 on the GCW 
Zero, and the JZ4780 on the MIPS Creator CI20, trying to upstream 
support for this SoC into the Linux kernel. Owning the RetroMini means I
 can test the drivers I write to one more Ingenic SoC, and start to 
support it upstream.</p>
<p>To write code for the RetroMini, I need two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>a way to load my code into the RAM and have the CPU execute it;</li>
<li>a way to see what my code is actually doing.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Loading the code</h2>
<p>Point 1). is easy; by powering ON the RetroMini while pressing B, the
 CPU will switch into a special mode where it will listen for commands 
on the USB bus. By sending specially crafted commands, it is possible to
 load custom code to the RetroMini. To make the process easier, I wrote a
 tool called&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/opendingux/jzboot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jzboot</a> that will upload the code to the RetroMini.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Debugging the code via UART</h2>
<p>The simplest way to debug your code is to just make it print stuff to
 the output console. Print register contents, print ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù if your 
check worked, print ‚Äúoh noes‚Äù if it failed‚Ä¶ If your program outputs text
 to the console, the whole process of writing a program becomes much 
easier.</p>
<p>The problem is getting the text output.</p>
<p>When you load code to the RetroMini, its hardware is in an 
uninitialized state; the RAM won‚Äôt work, the micro SD won‚Äôt work, and 
the LCD won‚Äôt work. This means that unless you write code to initialize 
it, you won‚Äôt be able to display text on the LCD. Thanksfully, there is 
another way, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter" target="_blank">UART</a>.
 By connecting the TX and RX pins of the UART of the SoC&nbsp; to an 
external UART receiver, we can receive on a PC the output of our 
program.</p>
<p>By looking at <a href="/assets/JZ4725B_DS.pdf">the datasheet</a> (section 2.3.2) I could deduce that the <strong>TX</strong> pin was the pin number <strong>58</strong>, and the <strong>RX</strong> pin was the pin number <strong>57</strong>.
 Following closely the traces on the PCB (with a multimeter), I ended up
 soldering wires to the following points (click to enlarge):</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/rs90_uart_pads.jpg"></p>
<p>You should connect these pins to a UART-to-USB adapter. Search for <strong>FTDI</strong> on your favourite online store. Here is an example: <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/FT232RL-FTDI-USB-3-3V-5-5V-to-TTL-Serial-Adapter-Module-for-Arduino-Mini-Port/222721031019?epid=1983299799&amp;hash=item33db353b6b:g:vdoAAOSwEZdaDLpc" target="_blank">UART to USB adapter</a>.
 The important thing is that it should work in 3.3V. Most of these 
modules come with a jumper to toggle between 5V and 3.3V I/O, it must be
 set to 3.3V if you don‚Äôt want to toast your RetroMini.</p>
<p>Then, solder the PCB‚Äôs <strong>TX</strong> to the adapter‚Äôs <strong>RX</strong>, the PCB‚Äôs <strong>RX</strong> to the adapter‚Äôs <strong>TX</strong>, and the two <strong>GND</strong> points together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Making the RetroMini more retro</h2>
<p>I didn‚Äôt want to solder my UART-to-USB module directly on the PCB, it
 wouldn‚Äôt look good and wouldn‚Äôt be practical should I want to actually 
play on the RetroMini. So I just drilled a hole on the back of the case 
and put a SUBD-9 connector there, the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù connector for UART:</p>

<p>Looks good right? üòâ</p>
<p>Next step: write some code!</p>
